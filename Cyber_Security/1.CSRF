### CSRF - Cross-Site Request Forgery
- Cross site request forgery (CSRF) is a vulnerability where an attacker performs actions while impersonating another user. For example, transferring funds to an attacker’s account, changing a victim’s email address, or they could even just redirect a pizza to an attacker’s address!
